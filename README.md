2. On your phone or desktop load the following page and allow access to your camera: https://karenstritz.github.io/arJsDemo/

3. Hold the marker in front of your camera to see a model of a tin toy robot appear. You may need to hold the marker at different angles to reduce glare or reflections that can interfere with the tracking.
