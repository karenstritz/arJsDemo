# arJsDemo

Setup Steps:

1. Load the following tracking marker image on your desktop display or print it on a sheet of paper: https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg

2. On your phone or desktop load the following page and allow access to your camera: https://karenstritz.github.io/arJsDemo/

3. Hold the marker in front of your camera to see a model of a tin toy robot appear. You may need to hold the marker at different angles to reduce glare or reflections that can interfere with the tracking.

Tips for Experimenting:

1. If you would like to modify this simple setup with a different model or changes to textures, lighting etc. you can create a repo in github and follow these steps to host your project on a webpage: https://pages.github.com/

2. If you want to work outside of github, you can create a local web server using the steps outlined here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
